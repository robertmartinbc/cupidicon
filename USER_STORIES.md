# This file will explain what users should be able to accomplish within Cupidicon

# User's expectations

* I am a user. I would like to be able to request authors to write articles for me, within a designated time frame, that I am willing to pay for. The price I am willing to pay will be set by me.

* I want to be able to present the request to a pool of authors to fulfil my request. Once the request is fulfilled, I will decide whether the writing meets my requirements. 

* If I am happy, I will accept the authors work and they will be paid accordingly from my account. 

* If I am unhappy, then I want the ability to reject the article outright, or make a request to the author to edit to my requirements and resubmit.

* If I reject the author's work, the request will be sent back to the pool for other authors to work on. The original author shoud not have access to this.

* I want to be able to have multiple requests within the pool for different projects.

* I would like the ability to request a particular favored author.

* I would like the ability to provide feedback on an author.


# Author's expectations

* I am an author. I would like to fulfil requests made by users. 

* I would like to be able to select an article that I would like to write within the given time frame and the payment indicated.

* Once I have written the article I will submit it to the user for acceptance or rejection. 

* Once I have submitted the article I would like access to the pool again to work on other projects.


# Cupidicon expectations. 

* Users can submit multiple requests for articles to be written.

* Users can specify the rank of the author they would like to write the article.

* All authors will be expected to submit a sample of writing to determine their rank, which will be set by the administrator.

* Each article submitted is placed in the general pool and is available for an author to select, based on their rank.

* An author can only work on one article at a time. Once they commit to writing the article, this is removed from the general pool.

* An author will only have access to the general pool once they have submitted the request to the user to accept or reject. Or they decide that they do not wish to write the article, upon which the article is placed back in the general pool and the author can select another project.
