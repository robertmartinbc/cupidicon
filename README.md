== == Welcome to Cupidicon!

Cupidicon will be the first online portal for clients and authors interested purely in content writing based on sentiment.

It will be a portal for likeminded people to meet and enjoy each others work.

Clients can register to request articles to be written for a fee.

Authors can register to write the articles or share their work with others.

Anyone can read the articles in search of inspiration.

## Users

* Users can be clients, authors and readers. Users and clients need to register whereas a reader can view the website but not make any changes.

* Clients register and post requests for articles to be written by authors. They stipulate a fee they are willing to pay for the article. They will have their own account page to manage their requests. 

* Authors can register and select articles to be written. Every author is given a status of novice and their work will be vetted by an administrator. Depending on the qulaity of the work and the frequency of submissions, their ranking will rise accordingly. They will be have a profile page where they can view their work and manage ongoing requests.

* Readers can navigate the site and view the works submitted by authors and requests by clients. They cannot view a particular request unless they register. They will be able to see an overview of the reuqest but not particular requirements.

* Registration is free for clients and authors. A user can be both a client and an author. A minimum payment of $25 dollars will be required by clients to submit requests. Authors can stipulate the price they are willing to accept for payment.

* Once and article has been written and submitted by an author it becomes the property of the client upon being accepted. The author can view the article but they can no longer make any changes to it. 

## Loves Lexicon

* This is the portal where all articles will be submitted to. It will be categorised by a tabable interface. Categories will include stories, poetry, anecdotes. These will be themed on sentiment, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions. 

* Once an article has been selected it is no longer visible in the lexicon. Clients can stipulate a time frame for completion of the project. Authors can view the request and choose to write the article. They can also release it back to the lexicon pool if they decide not to write it.
