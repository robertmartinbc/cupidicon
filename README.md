== == Welcome to Cupidicon!

Cupidicon will be the first online portal for clients and authors interested purely in content writing based on sentiment.

It will be a portal for likeminded people to meet and enjoy each others work.

Clients can register to request articles to be written for a fee.

Authors can register to write the articles or share their work with others.

Anyone can read the articles in search of inspiration.

## Setup
